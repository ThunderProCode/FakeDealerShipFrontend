# Project Proposal: FakeDealership Website

## Overview

I propose to develop a comprehensive website for a car dealership named FakeDealership, integrating both frontend and backend functionalities. The website aims to provide users with an intuitive and efficient platform to search, filter, compare, and purchase cars from the dealership's fleet. The frontend will feature a user-friendly interface with key information about available cars, while the backend will consist of a C# API for managing and updating car inventory.

## Features

### Client Side
1. **Car Search Functionality:** Users can easily search for available cars based on various parameters such as make, model, mileage, MPG, and price.
2. **Detailed Car Information:** Each car listing will display detailed information including make, model, mileage, MPG, price, and additional features.
3. **Filtering Options:** Users can filter search results based on their preferences, making it easier to find the desired cars.
4. **Car Comparison:** A dedicated page will allow users to compare two selected cars side by side, with a drag-and-drop interface for seamless comparison.

### Checkout Process
1. **User-friendly Checkout:** A streamlined checkout process for users to complete their car purchase efficiently.

### Admin Side
1. **Content Management System (CMS):** An admin portal for easy management of the car inventory, allowing administrators to add, remove, or modify car listings.
2. **Popular Cars Table:** A table displaying cars with the highest number of views, aiding administrators in understanding customer preferences.
